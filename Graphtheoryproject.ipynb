In the real network, the mean of the minumum eigenvalues is -1.916625e-16 and their standard deviation 3.193487e-16. The minimum eigenvalues thus are clearly compatible with zero, and the situation is very similar in the random case. In general, the fact that this method is subject to numerical problems, plus the fact that the adjacency matrix has to be rescaled (and also dependent columns have to be deleted...) makes possible biological interpretation difficult.

Then I apply the same procedure on the random nework, by ranking the nodes according to degree centrality. I estimate the minimum number of nodes to control the network. The minimum eigenvalue of the Gramian is greater than zero when considering 44/39/41 nodes in the real network and 33 nodes in the case of a random network. However, the minimum eigenvalue at that stage is still numerically compatible with zero. Setting a threshold in the energy required to control the network, and looking at how many nodes are necessary to achieve control, given that fixed energy, could be a better way to investigate numerically the controllability, as it is done here https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811918302982. So, in the following code I fix the energy to $10^{10}$ and look for the number of nodes needed to control the network, given this energy. In the real network, 87 (ranked by degree centrality), 82, (ranked by betweenness centrality), 70 (ranked in a random order) nodes are necessary to control the network given the fixed energy. Selecting nodes according to the centrality measure thus doesn't seem to bring advantages in the controllability. In the random case the number of nodes needed seems much lower (54). These results are still affected by numerical problems, but they might be in accordance with the result of https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10011, that shows that random homogeneus networks are more easily controllable than heterogeneous networks such as the scale free ones.\n"
